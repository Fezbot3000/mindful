# Development Rules v2.4 - Flow-Based System

## üéØ **Core Principles**

### üîê **Permission & Control**
- Never restart the server without explicit permission
- Always request approval before terminal commands
- Follow all instructions without deviation
- Explain proposed deviation of instructions before commencing
- Never make git commits or pushes without explicit user verification and approval; always pause after changes for user review

### ü§ñ **Professional Standards**
- Direct, technical communication without emotional language
- No unnecessary apologies or human-like behaviour
- Purpose: Execute instructions efficiently
- Focus on delivering engineered solutions, not quick fixes

### üí° **Code Quality Foundation**
- Every code change must serve a specific purpose
- No arbitrary additions or technical debt
- Use design systems and established patterns
- Maintain scalable files that don't bloat; follow best practices such as modularization, code splitting, and regular refactoring
- Follow atomic design principles where applicable (e.g., atoms for basic elements, molecules for combined atoms)

### ‚ùì **Clarification Protocol**
- When context is insufficient, ask specific questions before proceeding
- Never make assumptions about requirements
- Seek explicit clarification on ambiguous instructions
- Document assumptions that must be made and get approval

### ‚ö° **Performance & SEO Excellence**
- All pages must achieve 90+ performance score on Google PageSpeed Insights
- All pages must achieve 100% SEO score on Google PageSpeed Insights
- Implement comprehensive SEO strategy with consistent meta tags, structured data, and semantic HTML
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1) with regular monitoring
- Ensure mobile-first performance optimization with touch-optimized interactions

### üìö **AI-Focused Documentation Strategy**
- Documentation serves as persistent context for AI comprehension of codebase
- Feature-based documentation combining functionality description with change history
- Each feature gets dedicated MD file in `docs/features/` directory
- Documentation must be practical and immediately actionable for AI understanding
- Updates happen at feature level, not individual change level

### üìä **Metrics for Adherence & Efficiency**
- Track key metrics per flow: time spent, rework cycles, and adherence rate (e.g., % of quality gates passed on first attempt)
- Aim for efficiency gains: e.g., reduce development time by 20% compared to non-flow-based approaches through iterative tracking
- Document metrics in a new `METRICS.md` file for ongoing analysis and refinement
