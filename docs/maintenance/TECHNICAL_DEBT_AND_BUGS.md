### **Bug #001 - Settings Menu Missing on Desktop**
- **Date Reported**: 2025-01-14
- **Date Resolved**: 2025-01-14
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Component**: Desktop Navigation (`main-nav.tsx`)

**Problem**: Settings menu item was missing from desktop navigation but present in mobile navigation, preventing desktop users from accessing Settings page.

**Root Cause**: Navigation items array in `main-nav.tsx` was missing the Settings entry that existed in `mobile-nav.tsx`, creating an inconsistent navigation experience.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added Settings icon import from lucide-react
- Added Settings navigation item to navItems array in `main-nav.tsx`
- Ensured consistency with mobile navigation structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/main-nav.tsx`

**Validation**: Tested desktop navigation now includes Settings link matching mobile navigation.

**Prevention Strategy**: Ensure navigation items are synchronized between mobile and desktop components during future updates.
